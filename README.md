# Quantum-computer-simulation-using-python

The world of Quantum Computing is equal parts new and exciting, as it is overwhelming and difficult.
However, it does not have to be! You do not need a Ph.D. in Physics or a lab of superconducting qubits to experiment on your own and get your feet wet in such a burgeoning field.
In this repository, I will be showing you how easy it can be to get started, and how you can be running quantum simulations of your own, and all you need is a laptop, some patience,
and a cup of coffee (optional for all you tea drinkers).
